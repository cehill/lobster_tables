## attach libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr) # install.packages('skimr')
library(kableExtra) # install.packages('kableExtra')
```
## read in data while skipping four header lines
```{r}
lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data/lobsters.xlsx"), skip=4)
```

# explore data
```{r}
skimr::skim(lobsters)
```

# create a pivot table (count lines by year) as a tibble
```{r}
lobsters %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_year = n())
```

#create a pivot table (count lines by site and year) as a tibble
```{r}
lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n())
```

#create a pivot table summarizing the count and also the mean size by year
```{r}
lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(),
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm))
```

#same as above but remove NA's and add stdev calculation AND assign it a name so it gets saved in our workspace.
```{r}
siteyear_summary<-lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## inspect our new variable 
```{r}
siteyear_summary 
```

## make a table with our new variable (guess it works now; makes an ugly table)
```{r}
siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()
```
There are `r nrow(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this report
```{r}
siteyear_summary<-lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(),
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = siteyear_summary,aes(x = year, y= median_size_mm, group=site, color=site))+geom_line()
```
